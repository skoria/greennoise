Green Noise Experiment took place on the 12th and 13th of December 2009, at the Arnolfini Art Centre, Bristol, UK for it's "[unCraftivism](http://www.uncraftivism.net)" weekend.

This is a variation on the [Ganzfeld Psychological Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_experiment), which uses white noise and sensory deprivation to induce hallucinations and for telekinesis tests.

The initial results of this particular experiment are that the device induces relaxation and sensory distortion after as little as 5 minutes, with sonic diffraction effects (like an auditory autostereogram), dissociation from the body and coloured shapes and even some more varied or intense hallucinations in most people after 10 or 20 minutes. The great majority found the experience pleasurable with only 2 people responding that they hadn't really felt anything of note.

In this case 3 devices were created, using various shades of noise and modes of sound generation , including Green Noise - defined as the background sound of the natural environment, and including computer generated, circuit and [arduino](http://arduino.cc) generated noise.

The device is intended for mass, simple and open production, inspired by Flux Kits and Flux boxes in the spirit of George Maciunas and as the basis for a fluxus event score which can be found in the [notes](http://greennoise.googlecode.com/files/greenoisereport.ods).

Here is the [source code used for an arduino based white noise device](http://greennoise.googlecode.com/files/prbsGen.pde) as well as project designs for 3 separate white noise devices and some piezoelectric earmuffs.

In addition I'm providing the [experiences](http://greennoise.googlecode.com/files/greennoiseexperiences.odt) of around 30 participants in the experiment throughout the weekend.
